# JournalSite

This is a journal web app I made for myself.
I got tired of always losing track of my physical journal, and wanted a way to write entries from anywhere.
It's a generic Django application that can easily be extended or modified to meet personalized needs.

## Features

- Streamlined interface for adding journal entries (Django admin)
- Tags for grouping entries by topic
- Minimal design
